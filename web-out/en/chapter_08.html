									<h1>Chapter 8: Examples and Other Technologies</h1>
						
			
																				            	<h2><a id="index_0"></a>Examples</h2>
																<p>We can do thousands of examples with this technology.
It is as simple as taking any other example from another language
and see how it would be written in <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>. Perhaps the simplest would be an example
that comes from XML, as it has many things in common with <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>
(the next chapter discusses this topic in particular).</p>
<p>I have obtained many examples from <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" wiki>Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>One (invented) xml example would be:</p>

												<pre>&lt;Library&gt;
    &lt;Book id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Title&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring&lt;/Title&gt;
        &lt;Author&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/Author&gt;
        &lt;Language&gt;EN&lt;/Language&gt;
        &lt;Published&gt;29 July 1954&lt;/Published&gt;
        &lt;Genre&gt;High fantasy Adventure&lt;/Genre&gt;
    &lt;/Book&gt;
    &lt;Book id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Title&gt;The Two Towers&lt;/Title&gt;
        &lt;Author&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/Author&gt;
        &lt;ISBN&gt;76542&lt;/ISBN&gt;
        &lt;Language&gt;EN&lt;/Language&gt;
        &lt;Published&gt;11 November 1954&lt;/Published&gt;
        &lt;Genre&gt;High fantasy Adventure&lt;/Genre&gt;
    &lt;/Book&gt;
    &lt;Book id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Title&gt;The Return of the King&lt;/Title&gt;
        &lt;Author&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/Author&gt;
        &lt;ISBN&gt;12345&lt;/ISBN&gt;
        &lt;Language&gt;EN&lt;/Language&gt;
        &lt;Published&gt;20 October 1955&lt;/Published&gt;
        &lt;Genre&gt;High fantasy Adventure&lt;/Genre&gt;
    &lt;/Book&gt;
&lt;/Library&gt;</pre>
												<p>The same thing if we pass it to <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>:</p>

												<pre>Library (www.examples.com/demo.stxt):

												<p>Another example in XML:</p>

												<pre>&lt;email&gt;
&lt;from&gt;John Smith&lt;/from&gt;
&lt;to&gt;Mery Adams&lt;/to&gt; 
&lt;cc&gt;Keyla Brown&lt;cc&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Project report&lt;/title&gt; 
&lt;body&gt;Hello Mery!! The book is finished!!&lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/email&gt;</pre>
												<p>In <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> it transforms into:</p>

												<pre>Email (www.example.com/email.stxt):

From: John Smith
To: Mery Adams
Cc: Keyla Brown
Title: Project report
Body: Hello Mery!! The book is finished!!</pre>
												<p>We see that the conversion between the two formats is immediate, but the <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> is much better looking.
By the way, <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> always has a grammar, while XML does not
until a dtd or an xsd are not applied.</p>

								            	<h2><a id="index_1"></a>Wikipedia (*)</h2>
																<p>I feel great admiration for wikipedia. I think it is one of the best projects that have been created on the Internet.</p>
<p><em>How could it benefit from <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>?</em></p>
<p>Well, wikipedia could have different templates:
actors, politicians, tv series, films, cities, countries, rivers,... sharing grammars in many cases.
For example, both actors and politicians can have biographies, but actors can also have a listing of films.</p>
<p>In addition, a mixture of <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> with the wikipedia language would be very interesting.
I think that this is a point where <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> beats most languages.
The mixture with the so-called &quot;lightweight markup languages&quot; is really spectacular.</p>
<p>Thus, mixed texts can be made of the following style:</p>

												<pre>City (www.wikipedia.org/city.stxt):
     
Name: Barcelona 
Autonomous Community: Catalonia
Country: Spain

History:
    {{Main|History of Barcelona}}
    The founding of Barcelona is the subject of 
    two different legends. The first attributes 
    the founding of the city to the mythological [[Hercules]].
    The second legend attributes the foundation
    of the city directly to the historical
    [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] [[Hamilcar Barca]],
    father of [[Hannibal]], who named the city ''Barcino''
    after his family in the 3rd century BC.
    ...</pre>
												<p>Another advantage is that with <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> we would not only have &quot;templates&quot; of
how a city information should be, but we could also
apply styles and formats depending on the document type.</p>

								            	<h2><a id="index_2"></a><span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> and other technologies</h2>
												            	<h3><a id="index_3"></a>Lightweight markup language</h3>
																<p>Lightweight markup languages have had a spectacular boom thanks to projects like Wikipedia.
Thanks to them we can define text in a much simpler way than having to write tags as with HTML.
But they have a big deficiency: They do not have a clear structure and semantics.</p>
<p>What&#39;s more, almost all of them deal with the text style:</p>
<ul><li>Bold</li>
<li>Italic</li>
<li>Lists of elements</li>
<li>Data tables</li>
<li>...</li></ul>
<p>It’s surprising to see what we can achieve if we combine these languages with <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>.
We get text that is easy to interpret, with defined semantics, and with the expressiveness of both languages.</p>
<p>One example:</p>

												<pre>Product:
    Name: Magic memory
    Price: &euro;10
    Description:
        This product produces a //magical rejuvenation//
        of your memory and provides an **immediate** effect
        on everyone who tries it.

        Effects:

        * Quick memorization
        * Automatic learning
        * Greater concentration</pre>
												<p>We see that we have given structure thanks to <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>, but the description is given
with a wikipedia style.</p>

												<div class="row">
            		<div class="assert"><p>The union of <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> with <em>Lightweight markup languages</em> is simply spectacular</p>
</div>
            	</div>
								            	<h3><a id="index_4"></a>Tex, Latex</h3>
																<p>Please forgive me if I criticize a lot. I never do it without giving an alternative or a reason. I like constructive criticism ;-)
I&#39;ve seen that one of the objectives of TeX is that a document be printed the same now as in 100 years.
It had seemed perfect... until now. Now I believe that the objective should be
that it means the same now as 100 years from now, and that it is <em>understood</em> now and in 100 years.
And the more people the better. This is not achieved with TeX, but it is with <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>.
A document is understood today and 100 years from now. How do I think it should evolve?
I would make documents in <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>, would specify a grammar for the different types of documents,
would allow TeX elements (such as formulas) in the same way that is done with lightweight markup languages,
and would use TeX as rendering engine.</p>
<p>I dare say that TeX is unbeatable in terms of rendering; and I think that it will be at least for 100 years more ;-)</p>
<p>What would a document look like? Well, a simple example would be something like this:</p>

Paragraph:
    Hello World!!</pre>
												<p>Well, there are thousands of possibilities and ways of approaching the problem, I leave it up to you to practice with them ;-D</p>

												<div class="row">
            		<div class="assert"><p>What have we gained with respect to just TeX?</p>
</div>
            	</div>
												<ul><li>Ease in creating documents</li>
<li>UTF-8</li>
<li>Defined structure</li>
<li>Semantic text</li>
<li>Readable text</li></ul>
<p>And in addition, we have kept the compactness in the creation of mathematical formulas
and in other elements where TeX is really a great language.</p>

								            	<h3><a id="index_5"></a>JSON (*)</h3>
																<p>JSON in general has nothing to do with <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>, but there are certain moments
where they might compete with each other. I am thinking in web services with REST.
I bet for <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>, because it is as easy (or more) to parse as JSON,
and it gives documents a clear meaning.
In addition, it is more flexible and easier to read when we embed a large quantity of text,
whereas in JSON all the escape characters must always be taken into account.</p>
<p>But you there is no need to worry too much. Apart from web services,
I don&#39;t think that JSON and <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> are direct competitors,
due to their different field of application.</p>

								            	<h3><a id="index_6"></a>Other (*)</h3>
																<p>There are other languages that may be similar to <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>, but I believe that none of them have been made with the same approach.
For example, YAML has some similarities in the way that it uses indentation,
or CofeeScript, which having a sometimes similar appearance, has nothing to do with <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>.</p>
<p><span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> aims to provide structure and semantics to the document,
while at the same time allowing a readable text for the majority of people,
regardless of their computer knowledge.</p>
