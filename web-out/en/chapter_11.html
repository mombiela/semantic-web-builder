									<h1>Chapter 11: STxT Parsing</h1>
						
			
																				            	<h2><a id="index_0"></a>Introduction</h2>
																<p>Parsing an <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> file is much easier than parsing files from other technologies.
It may seem contradictory, because it is actually a very powerful language, but at the same time it is
based on very simple principles.</p>
<p>I will explain my way of parsing a file. It’s possible that it is not the best nor the most optimal way,
but it’s one way of doing it. In fact, if you want to see the implementation I&#39;ve done
it is available online:</p>

												<div class="row">
            		<div class="assert"><p><a href="https://github.com/mombiela/stxt-parser"> https://github.com/mombiela/stxt-parser</a></p>
</div>
            	</div>
												<p>This implementation has been done in Java language, because it is the one I know best.</p>
<p>I hope <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> is successful, and that other implementations appear very soon.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t go into all the details, but I&#39;d like to explain
some points that require more attention.</p>

												<div class="row">
            		<div class="assert"><p>If you have no intention of implementing a parser do not go on reading.
The next chapter is much more interesting ;-)</p>
</div>
            	</div>
								            	<h2><a id="index_1"></a>Generic process</h2>
												            	<h3><a id="index_2"></a>Line parsing</h3>
																<p>The parsing process can be done line by line, so we can say that in general we have:</p>

												<pre>while not end of file
    read line
    process line
end while</pre>
												<p>During the process it is suitable to have a list of the last nodes we&#39;ve been finding per level,
as the correct processing depends on this.</p>

								            	<h3><a id="index_3"></a>Line processing</h3>
																<p>The first step in line processing is the <em>standardization</em> of the line.
A line is standardized when it is in compact (or semi compact) form, so we have to check whether it is,
and if it isn&#39;t, transform it. In the standardization the comment lines are also deleted.</p>
<p>We must keep in mind in standardization that if the previous node was a text node,
when we go over a certain level, it will be part of that same node. That is, after that it will be text. It will also be part of it
if it doesn’t reach the level but the line is completely blank,
in which case it will be translated by text with a line break (<a href="chapter_06.html#index_9">See advanced tutorial</a>).</p>
<p>Once we have compacted the line, processing continues independently, and we only need to get
the level of the new line and distinguish between a few cases:</p>
<ul><li>Are we on the first node?</li>
<li>Is the text line from a previous text node?</li>
<li>Does a new node start?</li></ul>
<p>In each of the cases the aim is to update the status of our variables, and continue with the process.</p>
<p>Note: The most important thing here is seeing that it is a process that can be done line by line,
and the decisions to take are relatively simple. This lets us have a very efficient parser,
which in turn may act as a grammar and node validator.</p>

								            	<h3><a id="index_4"></a>Validations</h3>
																<p>Validations are made at various points of the parsing:</p>
<ul><li>When creating a new node: when creating a new node we validate that its namespace can be infered.
Otherwise, it means that it could not be created in that position and it would be incorrect.</li>
<li>At the end of a node: When we close a node, it is validated.<ul><li>If it is a NODE type, we validate that the number of children is correct.</li>
<li>If it is not a NODE, we validate whether it has the appropriate content depending on its type.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>When do we consider a node as concluded? This is an interesting point,
because there are two circumstances that make a node to be concluded.
One of them is when another node with a level equal to or below this node appears.
The other one is when the entire file has been processed and there are no more nodes to validate.
At these points the node is considered as concluded and the validations can start.</p>

								            	<h2><a id="index_5"></a>Language nodes</h2>
																<p>We had said in the language description that the data types have no limitation
and are not linked to a language, so validations should only be checked
using regular expressions or methods that ensure this fact.</p>
<p>We have the following types of nodes:</p>
<ul><li>NODE</li>
<li>TEXT</li>
<li>URL</li>
<li>NATURAL</li>
<li>INTEGER</li>
<li>RATIONAL</li>
<li>NUMBER</li>
<li>BINARY</li>
<li>HEXADECIMAL</li>
<li>BASE64</li>
<li>BOOLEAN</li></ul>
<p>For example, regular expressions that we could use to validate nodes are:</p>

												<pre>BINARY       = ^(0|1|\s)+$
BOOLEAN      = ^0|1$
HEXADECIMAL  = ^([a-f0-9]|\s)+$
INTEGER      = ^(\-|\+)?\d+$
NATURAL      = ^\d+$
NUMBER       = ^(\-|\+)?\d+\.\d+(e(\-|\+)?\d+)?$
RATIONAL     = ^(\-|\+)?\d+\/\d+$</pre>
								            	<h2><a id="index_6"></a>Grammars</h2>
												            	<h3><a id="index_7"></a>Storage</h3>
																<p>We obtain the grammars from the Internet, but having to go search definitions remotely all the time
is not practical nor efficient. The most efficient strategy is to have a kind of grammar repository,
in the disc, and to go find them there. In case we do not find them, we would look on the Internet,
and that repository would be updated. It is also possible to set checking times or other strategies.
The idea is that grammars do not change over time, or are at least compatible retroactively.</p>

								            	<h3><a id="index_8"></a>Initial grammar</h3>
																<p>We should keep in mind that it is not possible to make a parser without having the grammar previously.
In order to parse a grammar we need to have the definition of the base grammar already parsed.
This is why there will be a definition of the initial grammar in the code itself.</p>

								            	<h2><a id="index_9"></a>Details to consider</h2>
																<p>There are some details that must be considered in parsing:</p>
<ul><li>Case-insensitive: All nodes are considered to be CASE-INSENSITIVE,
so the appropriate transformations should be made in the parsing process.</li>
<li>Base64: With the BASE64 text we must allow line breaks,
and make a standard parsing of the content thus obtained.</li>
<li>For reading lines we should take into account both UNIX and DOS formats.
Therefore we will allow both line break, and line break + carriage return.
We do this in order to allow faster editions of files from any environment,
although the most suitable thing would be to always use standard UNIX (only line break character).</li></ul>
