																				            	<h2><a id="index_0"></a>Note for the reader</h2>
																<p>This chapter may offend xml enthusiast readers.
Read at your own risk ;-)</p>

								            	<h2><a id="index_1"></a>The legend (**)</h2>
																<p>The origin of all evil: SGML.</p>
<p>It all began a long, long time ago, in a dark land called &quot;computer science&quot;.
Encodings thrived in that world. Sowing incompatibilities.
Hindering communications. Laughing at those that were not like them.
Some tried to be at peace with all of them.</p>
<p>And then they created the monster: SGML</p>
<p>The monster started saying what encoding it would keep. And the problem was solved.
But it was too much of an effort. A lot of strange characters were necessary.
Texts full of &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;xxx;&quot;. Unintelligible.</p>
<p>And they have reproduced. The world is full of its children. Little monsters that
fill the Earth with these characters, hindering reading for humans.
Only an elite handful can deal with the monsters. They are called &quot;The computer techs&quot;.
They are terrifying. Nobody wants to see them, but everyone needs them. They are obscure.
They speak strange languages.</p>
<p>But the monsters are still here. They have mutated. They are now called xml’s.
And people like them!!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>But a small group of people met and decided that it could not be.
They would create a champion. Someone who would illuminate them. Only one could remain.</p>

												<div class="row">
            		<div class="alert"><p>The time for <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> had arrived.</p>
</div>
            	</div>
								            	<h2><a id="index_2"></a>Nowadays (**)</h2>
																<p>The world is full of ugly documents, <em>xml&#39;s that we like...</em> but it’s a horrible format!</p>
<p>We are inheriting an outdated format, with outdated encodings, with a very computerized way of thinking.
And it is everywhere. And we still use it. And we want it to be there for everything... One minute! Stop!
Is it necessary? If we didn&#39;t know anything about sgml and wanted to have a txt fast for parsing, with structure,
with namespace, would we have created xml? I don’t think so. If we tell a child to make something up,
I guess that they never would have created xml... they would have made something more natural... THEY WOULD HAVE CREATED <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>!</p>
<p>Well, we have more experience and we have learned. Let&#39;s create it!</p>

								            	<h2><a id="index_3"></a>Initial contact</h2>
																<p>I don&#39;t want to scare you, but <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> compared with xml, is:</p>
<ul><li>Better looking</li>
<li>More compact</li>
<li>Simpler</li></ul>
<p>And you can also express the same things.</p>
<p>In other sections we will also see that:</p>
<ul><li>Automatic internationalization of semantics</li>
<li>Faster parsing</li>
<li>Everything is namespaces! And you can’t even see them!</li></ul>
<p>Let&#39;s see an XML example, and we will compare it with <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>, for starters.
It will be an easy example:</p>

												<p>Minimum XML length: 225<br/>
Minimum <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> length: 172</p>
<p>If we compare without xml header or <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> namespace:</p>
<p>Minimum XML length: 186<br/>
Minimum <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> length: 144</p>

												<p>I think nothing more needs be said. It is clear, but:</p>

												<div class="row">
            		<div class="assert"><p><span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> is simpler than XML</p>
</div>
            	</div>
								            	<h2><a id="index_4"></a>XML attributes</h2>
																<p>Let&#39;s go for an example:</p>

												<pre>&lt;example id=&quot;1&quot; show=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
    Hello World
&lt;/example&gt;</pre>
												<p>Attributes in xml have always been controversial.
What is an attribute and what should be a node? It is always difficult to decide.
It is quite accepted that attributes are like node metadata,
that is, they provide information but not about the content.
There are cases in which this is acceptable, but (in my humble opinion)
in most cases, they are a source of problems.</p>
<p>Another added problem is that everyone should keep in mind that attributes exist.
This affects DTD&#39;s, XSD&#39;s, libraries, programmers... And what for?
Actually they do not provide much. Only unnecessary complexity.
Besides, this is <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>. Everything has a meaning, and everything is important.</p>

												<div class="row">
            		<div class="assert"><p><span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> has no XML style attributes</p>
</div>
            	</div>
												<p>This makes it <em>BETTER</em>, not worse. Sometimes, <em>LESS IS MORE ;-)</em></p>
<p>The previous example in <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> would be:</p>

												<pre>example(...):
    id:1
    show:false
    text:Hello World</pre>
												<p>In general, we can always make something of the type:</p>

												<pre>node_name:
    metadata:
        m1:xxx
        m2:xxx
        m3:xxx
    node2:
    node3:</pre>
								            	<h2><a id="index_5"></a>DTD, XSD</h2>
												            	<h3><a id="index_6"></a>XSD, DTD, and <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span></h3>
																<p>Let&#39;s talk about dtd’s and xsd&#39;s of xml. They are documents that tell us how a valid xml must be.
They work well more or less, and each of them has its advantages and disadvantages.
If you look around on the Internet you will see what I mean.</p>
<p>In short, DTD is simpler than XSD, is less powerful, and is written in a different language than XML.
XSD is more powerful, more difficult to make and understand, but is written in XML, there is no need to learn another language.</p>
<p>And what happens with <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>? You should know it :-D It has the best. It is an <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> document.
Integrated into the language itself. Powerful and easy to learn. Just like <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> itself ;-)</p>

								            	<h3><a id="index_7"></a>Where is it?</h3>
																<p>I&#39;d like to see a typical xml problem disappear:</p>

												<div class="row">
            		<div class="assert"><p><em>Where is the grammar in this document?</em></p>
</div>
            	</div>
												<p>In <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>, <em>EVERYTHING</em> is on the web. When you want to create a document you have
to be able to see automatically its definition. The grammar should always be accessible.</p>

												<div class="row">
            		<div class="assert"><p>An <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> document has an associated grammar by definition.<br/>
Otherwise, it is not <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span></p>
</div>
            	</div>
								            	<h3><a id="index_8"></a>XSD of the XSD (*)</h3>
																<p>Anyone want to compare the xsd of an xsd? I&#39;ve been tempted to include it in the book,
but it would have taken up over 50 pages, and I&#39;m not exaggerating :-D</p>
<p>I’ll leave you the link, in case someone wants to see it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.xsd" xsd>http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.xsd</a></p>
<p>Is there someone who understands it? Excuse me, excuse me. Is there someone <em>who is not a superhero</em> who understands it?</p>
<p>In contrast with <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> most people would not have any difficulties understanding the <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> of an <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>.
I&#39;m going to show it, although we have already seen it in Chapter 4:</p>

												<p>That&#39;s it! Compare it! :-D <br/>
There’s no color!</p>
<p>Okay, it’s much simpler but, no one dares to read what comes out of the xsd&#39;s!
Everything is much more complicated. With <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> we have sought simplicity.
We like to do things by hand! Having an XML editor or reader should not be mandatory!</p>

								            	<h2><a id="index_9"></a>Parsers and validators</h2>
																<p>Does someone want to compare parsers and validators? There is no need to,
one with <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> is MUCH faster and simpler to implement. 
Why? It’s very simple:</p>

												<div class="row">
            		<div class="assert"><p><span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> has much fewer rules than XML</p>
</div>
            	</div>
												<p>This makes everything easier. The parser code is faster.
They have fewer errors. It is easier to maintain. To make.
In addition, another advantage is that parsing and validating can be done simultaneously.
With XML you must decide if you really have to validate the xsd... and where is it?
Here we go again with the same problem as always. With <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> everything is much clearer.
Any document has to have a definition of what it is like.
But it is very easy to make. It doesn’t take any time. It&#39;s worthwhile.
It is one of the great advantages of <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>.</p>
<p>Note: For fans of private information: if the <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> parser or editor
has its own <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> grammars repository, it does not necessarily have to be visible on the web.
I don&#39;t like it, I am against it, but there is nothing or no one that can prevent this.
In fact, sometimes it will be needed, as I had to do with my own book
before having the website up.</p>

								            	<h2><a id="index_10"></a>Namespaces</h2>
																<p>I have always hated XML namespaces. They are cumbersome, difficult to control, and usually tell us nothing.</p>
<p>Namespaces in <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> are completely different, as they are not difficult to make,
they provide all the necessary information, and we do not lose the expressiveness that is achieved with XML.
In fact, you can’t even see them! But they are always there, helping. Finishing the work.</p>
<p>In XML namespaces are a nuisance, provide complexity, and give little in return.</p>
<p>By the way, we have banished the http:// prefix from namespaces.
It is no longer necessary, as this would imply that it is different if it is obtained with http://
than if it is done with https://. This makes no sense, what does make sense is that it is from //.</p>

								            	<h2><a id="index_11"></a>Future</h2>
																<p>I have been very honest with my entire analysis of XML vs <span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span>, but there is something we must not forget.
XML has been around for quite a while. It is tested, it is used everywhere. It is a standard.
<span class='STxT'><span class='first'>S</span>TxT</span> is new, it has just been born, and it has a long way to go.</p>
<p>But I think that it is worthwhile.</p>
